# BDASProject

The usa_00007.csv file is the file i've used for this project

The following files are used for the following purposes:

BDASproj-Copy1-Classification.ipynb - for running my classification algorithms
BDASproj-Visualisations.ipynb - for making my data visualisations
BDASproj.ipynb - the main file i've used for this project. Has the logic for my dataframe operations, as well as my regression models
structure.json - I've saved the results of my GBT model's decision tree rules into this json file, and used it for visualising my decision tree with D3.js
